Modern experimental science often requires the generation of complex graphical displays using multiple scientific programming libraries. Large scientific programming libraries offer powerful functionality, both for data analysis and graphical display, which in turn allow powerful customization and fine-tuning of parameters for both analyses and plots. However, the ability to use a wide array of functions with many parameters leads to difficulty in tracking and recording the exact process of data analysis and figure generation, especially if the figures are exploratively programmed on a REPL command line, or if figures are programmed in a series of small customized scripts. In this report, we first review a history of the notebook programming paradigm. Then, we introduce examples of data analysis and figure generation workflows based on the notebook paradigm, to promote reproducibility. Finally, we provide open-source code to allow simple marking of Git information (both of the parent notebook and of libraries used) within this workflow in Python/iPython, Mathematica, iScala, and R. We further propose standards for reproducible publication of scientific graphics.
