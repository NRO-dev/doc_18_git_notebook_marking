Modern experimental science often requires the generation of complex graphical displays using multiple scientific programming libraries. Large scientific programming libraries offer powerful functionality, both for data analysis and graphical display, which in turn allow powerful customization and fine-tuning of parameters for both analyses and plots. However, the ability to use a wide array of functions with many parameters leads to difficulty in tracking and recording the exact process of data analysis and figure generation, especially if the figures are exploratively programmed on a REPL command line, or if figures are programmed in a series of small customized scripts. Here, we advocate for the notebook programming paradigm, first pioneered in the Mathematica environment. This paradigm has been successfully ported to the P introduce a simple data analysis and figure generation workflow to address this problem and to promote reproducibility. This method tracks the myriad libraries, analysis subfunctions, and graphing parameters by using git within a notebook interface. We provide open-source software packages to allow this workflow in Python/iPython, Mathematica, iScala, and R. We further propose standards for reproducible publication of scientific graphics.
